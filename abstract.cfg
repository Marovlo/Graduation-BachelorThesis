语音通信在后疫情时代已成为人们不可或缺的交流手段，作为传统手机通讯的迭代升级，承载于网络的语音通信VOIP技术，在拥有不输于传统通话的实时性的基础上更加强化了方便性与灵活性。
因此，VOIP技术不止能做到传统手机通讯的点对点模式，还能方便地模拟出譬如多人会议室等多对多的群组聊天场景并加以管理。更进一步，只要该设备支持某种特定协议，该设备甚至可以不局限于手机，
能实现电话、电脑、传真机、网页等多平台相互通信，从而大大提高跨平台的能力。

为了研究VOIP技术，本论文将会从SIP协议，一个在VOIP技术中广泛运用的协议入手。利用PJSIP开发库，设计并实现一个群组语音呼叫客户端及其配套服务器。
该系统的主要功能是实现客户端之间的群组语音通话和群组的管理。最终为用户提供一个交互友好、使用方便、效率和质量高的群组语音通信系统。

% ABSTRACT
\def\abstracten{
%Your abstract here, to make a new paragraph, give an extra blank line please.
Voice communication has become an indispensable means of communication in the post epidemic era. 
As an iterative upgrade of traditional mobile communication, VoIP technology, which is carried on the network, 
has strengthened the convenience and flexibility on the basis of the real-time performance of traditional calls. 
Therefore, VoIP technology can not only achieve the point-to-point mode of traditional mobile communication, 
but also easily simulate and manage many to many group chat scenes such as multi person conference room. 
Further, as long as the device supports a specific protocol, the device can even be not limited to mobile phones, 
and can realize multi platform communication such as telephone, computer, fax machine and web page, 
so as to greatly improve the cross platform ability.

In order to study VoIP technology, this paper will start with SIP protocol, a protocol widely used in VoIP technology. 
Using pjsip development library, a group voice call client and its supporting server are designed and implemented. 
The main function of the system is to realize group voice call and group management between clients. 
Finally, it provides users with a group voice communication system with friendly interaction, convenient use, high efficiency and high quality.
